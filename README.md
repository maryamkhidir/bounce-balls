# Bounce Balls
Bounce Balls is a simple game developed using plain JavaScript, HTML5 and some JQuery. It was designed for kids and anybody down with children games. :)
<h2>How To Play</h2>
Ten (10) balls of different colours <em>(Colour Balls)</em> are generated randomlly from an array of colours and they bounce edge to edge in a rectangular canvas <em>(Floating Canvas)</em>.<br><br>
On the other canvas box, a random Colour Ball is generated, you are click on the matching colour ball in the Floating Canvas before the timer runs down.<br><br>
If you click on the correct Colour Ball, you earn 5 points, and another Colour Ball is generated. You repeat the process untill the timer runs down <em>(you only have 10 seconds :))</em><br><br>
After the timer runs down, you can click on the restart button to continue the game without losing your score points. Have fun!
